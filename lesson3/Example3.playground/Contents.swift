import Foundation

// use typealias to define an Age type that represents age


// define a variable with name of your choice to hold your current age


// write a simple control flow, that check the above age variable
// when age is less than or equal to 2, prints Infant
// when age is less than 10, but greater than 2, prints Kid
// when age is less than 18, but greater or equal to 10, prints Teenager
// otherwise prints Adult
// verify result by changing your age variable
// try to make it as simple as possible



// use typealias and tuple to define a Person type which the first element is an Age type,
// and second element is an String type which holds the name of the person



// define a veriable using the Person type with name and value of your choice



// write another copy of control flow, which will check the age of the Person
// and prints something like Mike is Adult.
// verify result by changing the Person variable


// Use everything you've learnt by now, design a very simple student exam grading system
// what it does is it checks the score, and grade with A(90+),B(80-89),C(70,79),D(60-69),F(<60)
// you must at least use, typealias, control flow, tuple
// You should make the code as human readable as possible
