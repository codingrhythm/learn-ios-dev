// Say we have a list of names of all Australia State, which is 
// the best collection type to define the list of state names?
// why?


// Please use the answer above to define a list of Australia States
// Use for in loop to print all state names



// How can you write code to find if NSW is an Australia State?



// Find the differet numbers (not in both list) from following two lists
let listA:Set<Int> = [341, 542, 12, 45, 68, 76, 45, 12, 1, 3]
let listB:Set<Int> = [76, 12, 341, 3, 56, 88, 100, 125, 321]

// Find common numbers (included in both list)


// Can you use code to check if listC is a subset of listA?
let listC:Set<Int> = [1, 3, 12]



// Use an Array to define a list of Australia States, and each element 
// of the array should be a dictionary which contains some information
// about the state (name, population, captial city)




// Print out each state in following format
// State: NSW
// Captial: Sydney
// Population: 4452456




// Only print out state which it's population is more than 2 million
